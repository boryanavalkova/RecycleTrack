    <p>Recycle Track's purpose is to provide a way to lead a healthier and eco-friendly lifestyle. This manual will walk you through the app and provide guidance.</p>

    <h2>Log in</h2>
    <p>When the app launches you are asked to login. The login screen is a simple, flat design form containing 2 input fields and a login button. For the purpose of this demo the following data is provided:</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Username: eee</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Password: eee</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By default you are taken the log waste screen as a first time sign-in. The idea of this is to directly remind the user to enter their daily waste disposal.</p>

    <h2>Navigation screens</h2>
    <p>At the bottom of the app once you log in, you can see 4 navigation items:</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item"><a href="#dashboard">Dashboard</a></li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><a href="#logwaste">Log Waste</a></li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><a href="#analytics">Analytics</a></li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><a href="#help">Help</a></li>
    </ul>

    <div class="mt-4 d-grid gap-5">
        <div id="dashboard" class="mt-3 p-2 bg-light border">
            <h2>Dashboard</h2>
            <p>The dashboard represents an overview of the system. The user can see their overall recycled and general waste. There is also an option to select a date as a reminder. After selecting the date, the user will be able to click a button and create an event in their calendar app.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                Note: If a calendar app is not available or synced, a notification bubble will pop-up saying so.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="logwaste" class="mt-3 p-2 bg-light border">
            <h2>Log waste</h2>
            <p>The log waste screen contains a form in which the user can enter submit their waste on daily/monthly basis. The input must be numeric and the data is validated and returns a message of success/failure. The UI is straightforward and it contains 2 input fields and 1 button.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                Note: this screen opens first when you are a newly logged-in user. In this way Recycle Track nicely reminds to enter any waste disposal data.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="analytics" class="mt-3 p-2 bg-light border">
            <h2>Analytics</h2>
            <p> The analytics screen contains a graph comparing the recycled and general waste. In this way the user can compare the amount of waste disposal and be more mindful.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                Note: Recycle Track does not store any personal information, nor does require any. Only permission required is to allow app to send notifications.
            </div>
        </div>
