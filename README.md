# RecycleTrack
Mobile application for tracking household waste

About RecycleTrack:
RecycleTrack is a non-profit ecology group that is interested in popularising sustainable lifestyles and teaching gen-Z how to be environmentally friendly. RecycleTrack is a team of young enthusiastic people who are passionate about sustainability and being vocal about the human impact on nature.

The problem:
In order to spread awareness, RecycleTrack wants to develop a mobile application that helps people track their waste, so that they can see what impact they have and increase the amount of litter that is recycled in a household.
Current Situation:
The impact COVID-19 has on society on the environmental side is huge. The amount of plastic cutlery, packaging and masks waste has increased massively and instead of focusing on health and hygiene, people prefer to use throw-away products which are hard to decompose.

Objectives:
Provide a way of people to log their weekly/daily litter disposal;
Decrease general waste;
Increase recycled waste;
Suggest more sustainable products;
Provide a way of people to see analytics about their weekly/daily litter disposal;

Technical requirements:
Hybrid Android Application;
Free to download and use;
Have a login screen;
Have a dashboard to overview everything;
Have a details log screen;
Have a weekly/monthly analytics page based on the data that has been logged so far;
Have reminder push notification for waste collection days;
Provide basic branding for the app;
Database that stores all the data and is used to generate analytics;
Use an API to generate analytics (Google Analytics);

Budget:
Since we are a non-profit organisation, we do not expect any costs out of this application development based on the current requirements.
